## Notes

✅ **Specification passed all validation checks**

Validation completed: 2026-02-10

The specification is ready for planning phase. All requirements are clear, testable, and technology-agnostic. The feature scope is well-bounded with mocked data only, no authentication, and single-page focus.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: view default, P2: select ticker, P3: sidebar polish)
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Edge cases identified and addressed
- Scope explicitly limited to demo/foundation purposes
